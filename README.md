# Extremal-Point-Density analysis
A matlab code for fast extremal-point-density analysis. Please cite the following papers if you use these codes in your research.

Due to the new version of the JIT of Matlab, the pure m-code is as fast as the mex-c. Therefore, we provide here only a pure m-code for the Matlab version.

The Python and Julia versions are coming soon. Please concat me via yongxianghuang@gmail.com if you have any questions about the code or theory.
